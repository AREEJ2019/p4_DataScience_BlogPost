# Project Motivation
Crime incident report are provided by Boston police Department(BPD) to document the inital details surraounding an incident to which BPD offecers respond. this is a data set containing records from the new crime incidents report system,which includes a reduced set of fields focused on capturing the type of incident as well as  when and where it occured.Records  begin in June 14  of 2015 and continue to september 3 of 2018\".this dataset contain information about crimes in USA Boston which will be used  in the 4th project od data science Udacity Nanodegree.\n",
"This project will follow the CRISP-DM process (Cross Industry Process for Data Mining)
In this project, will focus to answer this 4 questions:
- Does crime get higher in weekdayes or weekend?
- what is the 10 most famouse type of OFFENSE_DESCRIPTION in boston?
